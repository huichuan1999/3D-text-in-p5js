Synthetic biology is a mix and match of everything, combining and recombining across the tree of life. 

Making this single homogeneous tube of protein took tens of thousands of tries designing the perfect cell.

Designing a yeast to make something isn’t just about the gene that encodes the protein, there’s a whole system. The DNA on its own doesn’t do anything, the DNA must interact with the RNA polymerase inside of the yeast cell to be transcribed into RNA, which can be translated into protein.
