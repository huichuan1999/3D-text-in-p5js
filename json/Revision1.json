    "text": "When cytogeneticist Barbara McClintock developed her theories on chromosomal crossover, or “jumping genes ”  through her observation and studies on maize in the 1940s, the world had not yet understood the basic structure of DNA. Chromosomal crossover, or crossing over, is the exchange of genetic material during sexual reproduction between two homologous chromosomes' non-sister chromatids that results in recombinant chromosomes. McClintock conducted numerous crosses between maize plants with different color variations and meticulously recorded the inheritance patterns in subsequent generations. Through this, she identified instances where certain color traits moved or jumped to different positions on the chromosomes."
